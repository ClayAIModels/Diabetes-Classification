# Diabetes-Classification
Logistic classification model

This dataset originates from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Its purpose is to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on specific diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. The selection of instances from a larger database was subject to several constraints. Notably, all patients are females of Pima Indian heritage who are at least 21 years old.
The dataset contains various variables, some of which are independent (medical predictor variables), while one dependent variable (Outcome) serves as the target.
